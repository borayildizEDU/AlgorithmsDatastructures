- An ArrayList, or a dynamically resizing array, is an array that resizes itself as needed while
still providing O(1) access. A typical implementation is that when a vector is full, the array
doubles in size. Each doubling takes O(n) time, but happens so rarely that its amortized time
is still O(1).

- Basically, in C++ "ArrayList" is a "Vector". Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.
